We currently operate 6 urban and 5 rural centres in Maharashtra, serving approximately 2,000 beneficiaries. In our Vikas project, we aim at setting up a new community centre in the urban slum of Rabale in Navi Mumbai, for families of the migrant workers. The focus will be on educating and building awareness among urban communities about issues relating to the rights and responsibilities concerning their children, themselves and the society they live in. The children that will be supported by our program belong to underprivileged migrant backgrounds, and are typically on the verge of dropping out from their schools. We will provide them with support classes in subjects like Math, English, Science and Computers and cultural activities. They will also receive daily mid-day meals and regular check-ups in Health camps. We plan to conduct awareness programmes to eliminate child labour. Most of the women of these communities are uneducated and unskilled. They are unable to get decently paid jobs/work and are often exploited by their families and the neighbourhood. They are forced into the flesh trade when their husbands abandon them. Parents do not welcome the birth of daughters.

Our prevention work is located in urban bastis or slums where impoverished children and families are supported and empowered to create a safe environment for children. Our work is centered around children who are normally invisible, such as children hidden away in childcare institutions; working adolescents who do not have the benefit of protection under inadequate labour laws; out of school children who are isolated in their homes or at work in the informal sector, children engaging in illegal and risky activities. We believe that if children, adults and state authorities engage with one another to identify, build and strengthen mechanisms that ensure children protection, then communities will be safe for all children.

Agragami owes much of its current focus and expertise to the impeccable training and excellent training material that Pathfinder has generously shared with Agragami. Among other agencies for whom Pathfinder has carried out capacity building programs are Plan International, Packard Foundation Programs of the National Foundation for India and Nav Bharat Jagriti Kendra of Jharkhand, World Vision, and UNICEF. b. Intervention programs: Agragami's first intervention project was a primary health clinic at Cowl Bazar, a congested slum area in Bellary, Karnataka inhabited by low income groups having less or no knowledge on reproductive and sexual health. The clinic offered basic clinical services including contraception, MTP, ante-natal care, well baby and post-partum clinic. Thed clinic also focused on preventive measures through out-reach activities in the community. Since July 200 Agragami India has worked as a behaviour change communication (BCC) partner of UNICEF in Bihar, conducting training programs for block coordinators, BCC facilitators and panchayat captains to develop their skills as trainers. Technical assistance has also been provided to the BCC facilitators to help them in training village volunteers as village level interpersonal communicators on key health and development related behaviors: breast feeding, routine immunization, hand washing, girls' education and HIV/AIDS.",http://www.ngoimpact.com/ngoadmin/public/ngo_profile/logo_avtar/agragami-india-ngoimpact-86663.png,Agragami India Best Non-Government Organizations & Social Enterprises in India – NGO Impact,perm_identity Founded by Rekha Masilamani ( 15 years of experience ),"room 1/A, Vivekanand Marg North S K Puri,, Boring Road, Patna, Bihar- 800013",,Livelihoods / Poverty Alleviation,Bihar,18,"₹ 1,200,000"

Though the government machinery is in place to cater to the need for education, most of the children are turning out to be dropouts due to numerous factors. The situation further accentuates as we move towards the rural interiors and tribal habitations. Rural hinterlands which hosts the major chunk of our population is unable to educate its children due to varied reasons like: Identity as a criminal (Pardhi) community.No awareness about Education.  Lack of proper infrastructure. Lack of proper guidance.  Lack of competitive environment.  High teacher-student ratio.  Declining level of commitment amongst the teachers. Lack of stringent mechanisms to make hold of the educational committee of the village accountable for the growth of the children.  Children being seen as a source of economic income. TARGET GROUP: The Pardhi children who are unable to attend school and lack even basic shelter and food because of poverty will have first priority, focusing especially on: Children from very poor families Orphans  Children from ST community Children who have dropped out of schools. In pursuance of its objectives, Ajit Foundation proposes to set up a primary and secondary school at Khandavi, Barshi block of Solapur District, 5 km away from Barshi city. The overall aim of the project is to educate the Pardhi children in order to equip them with life skills, competencies and attitudes to enable them to harness and sustainably engage with their environment, be able to earn a living, and meaningfully contribute to the development of the country. With the knowledge and skills acquired, the youth will be well positioned to provide quality level services, but more importantly, the school will enhance the capacity of the students. For this purpose, setting up a childrens village where the organization can provide these children with a home, free or subsidized education and vocational skills which gives them opportunities and hope for a brighter future.

Initially a single-room drop-in centre, AAWC eventually developed into a resource centre to better address the women’s needs, providing them with professional counseling, medical care, micro-savings facilities, and other services – the Umeed (""hope"") program. As AAWC’s outreach team developed a regular home-visit schedule, they realised that the daughters of Umeed women were at great risk of being coerced into prostitution due to their extensive exposure to the brothel system and to their lack of educational opportunities. As a result, the Udaan (""flight"") program launched in October 2000 to prevent second-generation trafficking. In June 2002, AAWC expanded its services to include the young toddlers of women as well through the launch of the Umang (""joy"") program. Today, AAWC operates two centres, one in the Khetwadi lanes and another in the Kamathipura lanes, two communities which together comprise the largest and oldest red light district in Asia.

http://www.ngoimpact.com/ngos/avehi-public-charitable-educational-trust#profile,"It all began in 1952 on the banks of the River Narmada in a village in South Gujarat. Shanta Gandhi, an educator with eclectic interests, and diverse training in science, theatre, dance and politics had started working with a group of children in order to develop a curriculum that had relevance to their lives. The atmosphere was informal and the curriculum not pre-planned. It evolved naturally in response to the needs of that group and as a result of her interaction with those children. Children asked questions about their surroundings, and the process of finding answers (through games, songs and discussion) led naturally to questions regarding human evolution - how life emerged, why we are what we are, how our lives have changed from the past, and so on. Later, the curriculum was further developed in an experimental school attached to the B.M. Institute of Child Psychology and Development in Ahmedabad in the late 1950s. Here again, it was not based directly on the formal school curriculum but supplemented it. After a long interval, the programme was taken up in the 1970s at the Bal Bhavan, in New Delhi. Children who came there were provided an opportunity to interact with teachers, writers and artists, and to explore their surroundings through art, drama and dance, while all the time asking questions and discovering the answers. Unfortunately there was another long break before the programme was revived in Mumbai in the 1990s. Since then, the Avehi Abacus Project has developed three integrated packages of educational materials for students and teachers in the formal as well as the non-formal streams of learning",To provide stimulating reading materials that will help develop children's reading skills and foster values that promote harmony and celebrate diversity .To build capacities of project staff in aspects related to changing contexts and challenges of the present education system,Public Charitable Trust,AAATA0893R,E-8193 - 18-06-1991,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"₹18,640,225 ₹18,640,225",₹0 ₹0,₹0 ₹0,"₹18,640,225 ₹18,640,225",₹0 ₹0,₹0 ₹0,₹0 ₹0,75,N/A,N/A,N/A,Finance,7,N/A,,,"Other Domestic NGOs, Other Foreign NGOs, Domestic Companies N/A","Aga Khan Foundation  Elsie Spykman Foundation REACH India Asha for Education, Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, ,   Narotam Sekhsaria Foundation",01-01-2015 02-02-2016,31-12-2015 31-12-2016,N/A N/A,Maharashtra Maharashtra,Mumbai Mumbai,N/A N/A,"₹18,640,200 ₹70",₹0 ₹0,"40,999 0",Non-Government Non-Government,,,"Project description 1) Material Printing: Production (printing, assembling) of teachers and children's materials (worksheets and fact-sheets).

http://www.ngoimpact.com/ngos/central-himalayan-environment-association#profile,"The Central Himalayan Environment Association, CHEA in short, was founded on October 2, 1981, on a day which has special significance for India, being the birth-day of the Father of the Nation, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. The society was registered soon afterwards in May, 1982. Arguably CHEA is one of the earliest societies founded in Northern India which had ' the environment and the livelihood of the people in the Himalayas ' as its core concern. Much water has flown in the great Himalayan rivers and the Indian Himalayas have since been witness to much distress, conflict, degradation, demographic dynamics, political restructuring and impacts of various global revolutions and their regional and local impacts. CHEA has since espoused many mountain causes, engaged itself actively in scores of action-researches on human and environmental aspects and livelihood-related projects and continues to be so involved to this day. Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 with the inclusion of Chapter 13- 'Managing Fragile Ecosystems : Sustainable Mountain Development' in the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) the importance of mountain social-ecological systems have been acknowledged for the first time on a global scale. Establishment of CHEA, let it be recalled, pre-dated the Rio Summit by more than a full decade. Certainly the perceptions of a seminar organised in October 1983 by CHEA in participation of academicians, activists and scientist to se the future course of action for the Indian Himalayas has to be re-evaluated in context of the insights the world at large and the Indian sub-continent in particular has gained and with which CHEA has a re-alignment of its strategy for the 21st century, both in context of local and global priorities. To ensure solution of increasing pressure on natural resource for rural livelihoods CHEA has developed strategies for stregthaning grassroots environmental governance and undertaking action research.","VisionEnsure the development of prosperous and secure mountain communities that are peaceful, equitable, and environmentally sustainable.MissionOur mission is to integrate rural livelihoods and sustainable conservation practices to reduce the environmental, economic, and social vulnerabilities of the mountain people. In cooperation with regional and international partners, and working with the communities, we aim to develop and provide integrated and innovative solutions that guide policy change and inspire action to directly benefit the mountain people and their environments. The Himalayas are the principal home of glaciers and the source of water for over 1 billion people living in connected river basins. They are also extremely vulnerable to climate change.

Earlier in 1997 Children Toy Foundation (CTF) used to arrange play sessions in the evening for street children around its office at Fort, Mumbai. Everyday around 30-40 children from the surrounding used to come here to play. Prompted by this overwhelming response & in its quest to reach out to more children at distant places, we had the idea of developing a mobile service which has today grown to large project. The van was named as LAFF van (Let's All have Fun & Frolic). LAFF van has helped to propagate the toy library project in Northern states of India all the way up to Jammu & Kashmir. Godrej Ltd & many Lion's Clubs had sponsored the trip. The LAFF van has been to 162 villages of Latur District & to an equal number off villages in Nashik district on sponsorship of Excel Industries Ltd. We were invited by Nutan Balshiksan Sangh Parivar to travel with our toy van from Kosbad (Maharashtra) to Bhavnagar (Gujarat) for the celebration of Amrit Mahotsava of Nutan Balshikhsan Sangh. It has given a wake-up call to several educational institutions and to leaders who have a better future for children in their minds & hearts. It has made them come out of their comfort zone & join the movement. We have provided guidance & training to Vidyarambam Trust, Chennai, to design two such vans for the benefit of Tsunami-affected children. They are working with an NGO which would like to make two vans, and even Healing Hands Women's Organization, Sri Lanka is planning a mobile toy van service under our guidance. LAFF van helped CTF get access to many donors who were inspired to set up toy libraries at different places. The colorful vans easily lure the imagination of the children. On the body of the van there are many games painted & more than a hundred children can play with magnetic counters in groups. The van has lots of toys & games which are both educational & entertaining. There are specially designed games for groups. The specially designed group game on the van is an open invitation for a number of children to come together.The van has an in built video system for viewing educational video films & also for playing video games. Occasionally puppet & magic shows are performed to engage & entertain children. It has a projector for big screen viewing so that a larger number of children are able to see and mike system for children to interact with each other with jokes, poems, etc. The van stacks around 300 toys and other games along with hobby kits of stamps, coins, cards, etc. The budget of the program is Rs22 crores which is a very optimistic one, given that the income of CTF in FY15 was Rs17 lakhs. The program budget is Rs60.98 lakhs per van, for 36 vans. The budget per van includes one-time cost Rs25.85 lakhs (Tata van,fabrication of van,content development,toys/books/TV), recurrring expense Rs20.42 lakhs (salary,fuel), office expenses Rs14.71 lakhs",http://www.ngoimpact.com/ngoadmin/public/ngo_profile/logo_avtar/children-toy-foundation-ngoimpact-33090.jpg,Children Toy Foundation Best Non-Government Organizations & Social Enterprises in India – NGO Impact,perm_identity Founded by Mr. Devendra Shivlal Desai ( 15 years of experience ),"room Block 20, Birla Mansion, Prarthana Samaj, Dr. D.D.

http://www.ngoimpact.com/ngos/human-education-and-action-for-liberation-movement#profile,"Human Education and Action for Liberation Movement abbreviated as HEAL Movement derives its name from the commitment to the right to life and livelihood of the Dalits who have been suffering from social exclusion and economic marginalization for centuries. There have been many barriers that contribute to the social exclusion and political- economic marginalization of the Dalits. The barriers are religious dogmas, political system and the caste system. Outwardly, they seem to be separate institutions but at functional level, there exists an unholy alliance among them against the Right to Life and Livelihood of the Dalits. The people with vested interests, mainly from the upper caste community, used to control these institutions and keep the Dalits under a semi bonded labor system without access to basic rights. The caste system, sanctioned by religion and supported by political system, justified the social exclusion of the Dalits and political – economic marginalization.  As a result, Dalits occupy the lowest rung of the social ladder in the social structure. Therefore, HEAL focused on the Human Education of the community.  Human education focuses on sensitizing them on the origin of caste system, religious institutions, their role in social exclusion and political marginalization of their community.  We felt that a community can be empowered only through education.  Only when they are educated about their situation, Rights and the ways to achieve their Rights they can act.  Hence massive awareness programmes were conducted to sensitize the people.  This sensitization, HEAL believed, would enable them to reject these doctrines of exclusion and bondage and assert their right to equality and dignity that would ensure their Liberation. The liberation entails collective Action by the people.  Therefore, HEAL imparted appropriate awareness education that would eventually lead them to understand their livelihood rights and act on strengthening their social capital - Movement - through grass root level organizing.  HEAL believed that it could facilitate this process through deeper level socio political education and functional training – a training that involved the women to participate in the action to address their rights and liberate themselves from the socio – cultural bondage. HEAL being a Right Based NGO, its interventions were initiated through lobby and advocacy with the civil society organizations for their Rights. Working in co-ordination with other like minded Movements is one of our strategies. The name HEAL reflects this line of thinking in its goal, strategies and in the programs implemented.","Vision :HEAL visualizes an egalitarian society based on equality, justice and opportunity to all irrespective of caste, religion or socio economic status.

For JWP, the women's question in India is both a concern for the female sex and an important part of the interrelated phenomena including caste, class, ethnicity, culture, religion, etc. JWP's programme to combat this total system of oppression and exploitation is therefore comprehensive in nature. The emphasis is on grassroot level organizing of women and the community in rural and urban areas. JWP promotes issue based campaigns and networking at the regional and national levels among women's groups and others. It carries out studies, research and documentation of information. Seminars, conferences and workshops are organized to inform, analyze and build the capacity of functionaries and thus promote necessary action. The legal and socio-economic rights of women, as well as their struggle for human rights, attracts JWP's attention. In the context of children, JWP realizes the little attention paid to child rights in the total development process in India. Its programmes are therefore planned to ensure holistic processes and laws, interventions and infrastructure for the survival, protection, development and participation of each child, irrespective of gender, caste, class and religion.",To prioritize  Women Empowerment.To focus education of girl child,Charitable Society,AAAAJ3629F,49003 of 2004 - 26-04-2004,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"₹2,000,750",₹0,₹0,"₹2,000,750",₹0,₹0,₹0,12,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Business Development, Finance",4,N/A,,,N/A,Tech Mahindra,28-02-2008,25-10-2016,N/A,Haryana,Gurgaon,N/A,"₹1,097,000",₹0,0,Non-Government,,,"Project description In 2008, there were two brothers in class I, children of Bangladeshi refugees. Both these boys, intelligent and enterprising, had won all the class prizes in the JWP centre. During a meeting, the JWP Director asked the children what they would like their centre to be called. One of the brothers immediately said “MERA SAHARA” and all the children endorsed it. The centre thus acquired its name. The explanation given by the children was, that this centre while giving them support and shelter, was also equipping them for their future life. Overnight, in early 2009, these two brothers and their families disappeared. Nobody could say if they had gone away due to police threat. In the process, two of the best students were lost to the Centre. It is hoped that they have been able to continue to study in the place they have moved to. MERA SAHARA will always remember them. The parents are construction workers, part time labourers and domestic workers who go to work early morning and return late in the evening. Their children thus are not cared for, running about in the streets and bylanes, and falling easy prey to anti social elements. A survey by JWP revealed that over 500 children required care and protection in this area and therefore the decision to start an Education-cum-Protection centre for Nithari children became urgent.

http://www.ngoimpact.com/ngos/kolkata-sanved#profile,"In 1996, Sohini Chakroborty post graduate student of Sociology visioned that dance and sociology can work together. With this idea Sohini along with sociologist and dance activist, started a dance project with ‘Sneha’, a shelter and care home for trafficked women and girls. For the next 8 years, Sohini experimented with breaking the barriers of traditional dance. Through her exposure to formal tenets of Dance Movement Therapy(DMT) training after workshops under several expert DMT specialist and therapists with the British Council, American Dance Therapy Association and other places, she was excited by the scope of the particular utility that dance and body movements could become a powerful rehabilitation tool as well as a method of advocacy. Dance Movement has the ability to transform a victim into a proactive advocate for change. 1998: marked the initiation of a pilot project called Rangeen Sapney (colorful dreams) which resulted from interlacing various artistic techniques like mime, music, physical theatre and dance. It was launched between 1999-2000, and was aided by the government. One hundred twenty vulnerable children rescued from the red light area were reached out through this project. Sanved as Platform 2000: attained achievement from the pilot project led to the birth of Sanved in the year 2000, which served as a stage for creative expression. At the bud stage it primarily focused on advocating about the impact of dance on one’s life through performances, workshops and sessions with the children. On 29th April’04 Kolkata Sanved was established with the mission that all individuals, from marginalized and mainstream populations, should live with dignity and self-respect.","MissionKolkata Sanved has pioneered the use of Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) as an alternative approach to counseling, psychosocial rehabilitation, expression, and empowerment. The organization has started using DMT as a therapeutic tool in 2004 for those who are most vulnerable and underprivileged; enabling young women survivors of trafficking to emerge as self sufficient leaders and DMT trainers. Breaking through barriers of traditional counseling and therapy, Sanved uses movement and dance to enable individuals to reclaim their physical selves and their souls through a newfound sense of freedom, peace and confidence.Kolkata Sanved’s core programme ‘Saving Lives through Dance’ works with different marginalized communities in collaboration with Government and NGOs. Kolkata Sanved is the very 1st organization not only to explore the artistic skills of the marginalized communities but also give recognition that the marginalized communities too have the right to develop artistic skills. The organization has broken all barriers to prove that development and art if blended together skillfully then the resultant can prove to be very productive for developing the lives of the individuals. The core employees of Kolkata Sanved belongs to the marginalized communities, after going through the DMT process themselves they have both understood and realized the impact of DMT on one’s life, they had adopted DMT as an alternative career option.The uniqueness of Kolkata Sanved’s program lies in the fact that it harnesses the power of dance in two distinct yet interrelated ways: dance as an art form and dance as expressive movement therapy focused on self empowerment.VisionKolkata Sanved believes that all individuals, from marginalized and mainstream populations, should live with dignity and self-respect.

http://www.ngoimpact.com/ngos/lead-foundation#profile,"Education is every child’s right. The UN and the Indian government agree. In fact, basic education is the right of every Indian child. On paper, at least! But what if you are elder sister to three other siblings and your mom and dad ask you to cook and care for them while they go off to dig roads or build skyscrapers brick by brick. What if you are barely in your teens but are already on a payroll bringing in the money to help a sick parent? That’s when education takes a backseat! Unfortunately, this is a recurring story in India and while it is not possible to change this overnight, we believe we can make a change, little by little. LEAD is a group of young people united by a desire to educate and thereby, change destinies. Love, Education and Aspiration to change Destinies — that is what LEAD stands for. LEAD is also an attempt to create leaders, individuals who step up and take the responsibility to initiate change, although they haven’t been asked to do so.

Often, even if parents are able to send their children to school, they choose not to because of lack of money for clothing, supplies and transportation. This story is unfortunately common in the villages and slums of big cities. Lily Foundation targets these children and imparts a basic minimum education to them. While the mother may be hawking vegetables on the curbside from early morning, the Lily Foundation takes care of her child in a Study Home, Primary Coaching Home or High School Coaching Home. Study Homes The school education is free in India. The children get the treatment of mid-day meals on all school days. Yet, illiteracy remains a big headache for the government as well as social reformers. The segment of society where both parents must work to earn a minimum livelihood is significant. These kids often fail to receive proper attention at home in their early childhood years. We literally make these kids literate by teaching from alphabets and numbers to first grade level language (Bengali and English) and Math in a disciplined learning environment. Besides free education, we also provide free school uniforms, free nutrition snacks and free periodic health check. After two years of learning, we help them get admitted to a public school. Primary Coaching Homes There is a large number of primary students in Grade III through V whose parents simply cannot look after their ward’s homework assignment. As a result, the children become unmotivated and fall behind at school. To make things worse, there is no pass/fail exam held till the end of Grade V, which leads to a high drop-out rate at that stage. Primary Coaching Homes are established targeting these school children. The Homes run in volunteer’s premises or in other public facilities in convenient after-school hours, where the volunteer picks up the role of teacher. High School Coaching Homes The goal is to help the borderline students whose marks are close to the minimum grade practice enough to pass the Madhyamik board exam. Students of Gr. IX and Gr. X are coached by expert teachers who know the technique of apprehending the type of questions in the exam and can impart the skills to solve problems. The Homes are small class-rooms, usually held at a high school, where subject-matter experts teach English and Math. The coaching environment is made more attractive as it offers convenient off-school hours’ classes in cozy small groups of 20-30 students.

Our Mission: Magic Bus is committed to developing local community mentors who take children living in poverty on the journey from childhood to livelihood.

At Magic Bus, our objective is to break the poverty cycle, one child or youth at a time. Magic Bus equips some of the India’s poorest children and youth with the skills and knowledge to grow up and be successful, to move out of poverty, and to take control of their future. These life skills – which range from education and gender equality to health and employability – are taught by the youth leaders from the communities themselves, supported and trained through Magic Bus’ unique mentorship programme.

http://www.ngoimpact.com/ngos/mahan-trust#profile,"""Background: Melghat is a hilly, forest, difficult-to-reach tribal area (>4000 km2) in Amravati district of Maharashtra state, Central India. As this area is in forest with very inadequate facilities, most of the skilled personnel are reluctant of providing regular medical services in villages . In addition, Melghat has very poor transportation, almost 25% of the villages are unapproachable with no proper roads, etc. Even if a person has knowledge and awareness he is unable to access available medical facility. This underprivileged area had poor health care delivery system, hospital facilities & education. All these results in poor health indicators especially very high under 5 children mortality rate (>90/1000 live births), infant mortality rate(>60), maternal mortality rate (>250 / 1 lakh live births), age specific mortality rate(16-60 years) and malnutrition (>75%). In Melghat, tribal are very superstitious, believe more on traditional healing instead of doctors and reluctant to come to hospital due to poor socio-economic conditions. Thus, Ambulance cum Mobile Medical Unit (MMU) acts as lifesaving vehicle in hilly terrains of Melghat. Interventions: MAHAN will provide medical facilities to the poor tribal patients from 300 villages of Melghat & 100 tribal village of Madhyapradesh by MMU.

http://www.ngoimpact.com/ngos/literacy-india#profile,"Literacy India can rightly be synonymized with three very powerful words: Education, Empowerment and Employment. The very essence of Literacy India are these three E’s which are both powerful and paramount in transforming lives! Literacy India was born in 1996 as a non-profit organization with the objective of educating under privileged women and children, and empowering them to become self-reliant and employable. The name Literacy India is a misnomer because, although literacy is the predominant initiative of the organization, this initiative is reinforced with a variety of vocational skills and alternative models of education that are relevant, holistic and enriching. Capt. Indrani Singh, who conceptualized Literacy India says,” the idea is to equip underprivileged children and women with basic education and also identify, nurture and develop their latent talent and skills wherein empowering them and increasing their employability quotient”.","VISIONIt is Literacy India’s motto to impart basic education to women and children. The emphasis is on providing education not in a typical classroom manner, but to give a child a wider canvas of exposure in a socio-cultural environment. Literacy India envisions to keep its student’s at par with the fast evolving world around them. In line with this thought, Literacy India is looking at transforming the education landscape through exposing the student to a more innovative and non-traditional method of learning. This includes fun activities and workshops on group learning, drama, dance, role plays etc.Eminent personalities from different walks of life come and interact with the children and prove to be a catalyst to the child’s motivation and enthusiasm to do well. The interest generated in these activities also helps identify talent which, with further guidance can pursue further education or vocational training.OBJECTIVESAll Literacy India initiatives and programs are envisaged to be innovative, sustainable and replicable in different parts of the country. The primary objectives are:To support children in active schooling to provide minimum levels of learning.To provide women and children with vocational skills.To identify children from under privileged backgrounds and help build their confidence and awareness.To economically empower women from rural and slum areas.To nurture, mentor and assist children to become human resource assets in the community and future role models to many.To improve the self esteem and confidence of both women and kids from the under privileged segment.",Public Charitable Trust,AAATL0376J,23614 - 11-05-1995,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"₹1,223,000",₹0,₹0,"₹1,223,000",₹0,₹0,₹0,12,N/A,N/A,N/A,Finance,12,N/A,,,N/A,Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs,1/1/2016,31-12-2016,N/A,Haryana,Gurgaon,N/A,"₹1,250,000",₹0,0,Non-Government,,,Project description N/A,http://www.ngoimpact.com/resources/assets/image/no-image-available.jpg,Literacy India Best Non-Government Organizations & Social Enterprises in India – NGO Impact,perm_identity Founded by Indraani ( 15 years of experience ),"room J-1365, Palam Vihar,, Gurgaon, Haryana- 122017",http://www.literacy.org,Education,Haryana,0,₹ 0

This is a moment of great pride and achievement for us at Majlis Legal Centre as we have been actively campaigning on the issue for the last four years. The scheme provides an amount of Two Lakhs which can be extended to Three Lakhs in cases of aggravated assault. The amount will be disbursed in instalments. A survivor can access 50% of the amount as soon as she files an FIR and the balance amount on filing of the charge sheet. The outcome of the criminal trial is not a criteria for eligibility, In 2010 the centre cleared a scheme for Financial Assistance and Support Services to Victims of Rape: A Scheme for Restorative Justice. The scheme provided financial assistance as well as restorative support services such as counseling, shelter, medical and legal aid. It required setting up of Criminal Injuries Relief and Rehabilitation Boards at the District, State and National level. Accordingly in May 2011 the Government of Maharashtra constituted District Criminal Injuries Relief and Rehabilitation Board in all 35 districts of Maharashtra. However the funds never came as it was awaiting Planning Commission nod. Majlis Legal Centre organised several meetings with the then Law Minister, Dr. Moily as well as National Commission for Women to push the scheme forward. In 2011, Majlis organised a national level consultation ‘Compensation To Women Victims of Crime’, along with the National Commission for Women to bring to fore the problems with the implementation of the scheme. In the absence of financial assistance there was a need to atleast provide other support services to help the victim-survivor overcome the trauma and also negotiate the criminal justice system. Thus in 2013 Department of Women and Child Development entered into acollaboration with Majlis Legal Centre to provide Socio-Legal support to victims of sexual violence. RAHAT a pilot project was initiated in Mumbai. Since funds from the centre were unduly delayed, the Department of Women and Child Development, Government of Maharashtra drafted a state level scheme. The scheme met with several obstacles as we labored through various drafts. Meanwhile there were major changes in the law concerning sexual violence.  Child sexual abuse was placed under a separate  statute, acid attacks became a specific crime under IPC, etc.  Our efforts were to ensure that these changes are reflected in the proposed scheme. There was also a need to set up atransparent and easily accessible mechanism through which a survivor is able to access relief immediately, without too many technicalities and red tape. After several inter-ministerial meetings for obtaining required approvals, the scheme has been approved by cabinet today  (11th September 2013).  It will be launched on 2nd October, 2013. We thank Mr. Ujjwal  Uke, Principal Secretary, Department of  WCD for his support, foresight, compassionate approach and ingenuity while drafting the various clauses of the scheme. We also sincerely thank our Hon’ble Minister, Women and Child Development Ms. Varsha Gaikwad, for her consistent support and perseverance in getting the scheme approved by the State Cabinet, crossing all hurdles along the way. This timely news comes a day before an inter ministerial consultation has been organised by RAHAT to discuss modalities for providing ‘end to end support’ to survivors of sexual violence, using an inter-department convergence model.  The meeting will be presided by the Hon’ble Minister, WCD and will be attended by high level officials from all concerned ministries –  Home,  Public  Health, Law and Judiciary, Director of Prosecution, Commissioner of Police, Municipal Commissioner Brihanmumbai,  Collector of Mumbai, among others.",http://www.ngoimpact.com/resources/assets/image/no-image-available.jpg,Majlis Manch Best Non-Government Organizations & Social Enterprises in India – NGO Impact,perm_identity Founded by Flavia Agnes ( 20 years of experience ),"room 4A/2, Golden Valley, Kalina Kurla Road, Mumbai, Maharashtra- 400098",http://www.majlislaw.com,Advocacy,Maharashtra,0,₹ 0

The project for children aims to restart their education as well as to encourage them to acquire vocational skills that will help them to earn a living.

Formal education is one of the most significant means to impart information and knowledge in the modern-day living. Today good schools and inspiring teachers are considered to be the legal rights of every child. For actualization of universal elementary education goal, it is imperative to develop and imply progressive education model to replicate the success of various fruitful educational experiences on a large-scale with the available resources. Unless a model of quality education to children, particularly from poor urban families, is developed and credibly demonstrated, the problem of universal basic education in India cannot be solved. The strategy of Nidan is designed to unfold in three stages. In Phase I (2006-2007), the focus was on evolving and establishing core elements of learning methodology. In Phase II educational organizations are kept into focus which demonstrates potential efficacy of this approach. Both these phases lay foundation of an education design and delivery organization to implement the program at community level. Objectives- Attain complete coverage of children aged 3-14 years in elementary education in three municipal wards of Patna. To attain and maintain cent percent retention in project areas. Create model in quality of learning and to set up a Resource centre in Patna for qualitative learning. Empower the communities to enable them to strengthen their demand for free and quality education with the government. Phase II (2007-2008) was aimed to develop and to test & demonstrate all aspects of the learning model, class-process, preparation of teachers, learning material and program management. Phase III, Nidan would work towards integrating its design features within the primary education system. Various approaches and strategies would be employed. A partnership with government school system to introduce selected design features of Nidan in order to improve quality therein. Attempts would be made to persuade the proposition that lower primary education could be delivered by a multitude of independent units working on the Nidan pattern that would act as a feeder to the government and other upper primary schools. These units would not belong to any one organization, instead would compete for contracts or grants to run the feeder classes. In this phase, work could be taken up in a concerted manner with bilateral and multilateral aid institutions, particularly to address the requirements of urban areas. America India Foundation (AIF) is supporting one of Nidan’s education projects with the rag-pickers and sweepers of Patna. Nidan’s pedagogy seeks to facilitate the development of a child into a balanced individual with enhanced thinking and logical abilities, artistic temperament and sensitivity. Pre Primary Education (3-6 years) Currently Nidan is running 40 pre-primary centres providing pre-primary education to all children in the 3-6 years age group living in the slum areas of Patna. Nidan helps 5-6 year old children get enrolled in to Government primary schools wherein the mother teachers play a pivotal role in linking the children with pre primary centres and Government Schools and ensure that children are regular in the pre-primary centres/schools. Elementary Education (6 – 13 years) At Nidan, the elementary section is further divided into Shala Arambh (Class I-II or Early Primary) and Shala Madhya (Classes III- V). The overall emphasis is to groom children for their development as independent learners. At the Shala Arambh level, the focus is on building early language, literacy and numeracy skills. The aim, as the children move to Shala Madhya level, is to equip them to perform at comparable levels when they reach class V. Children are encouraged to play with the alphabets, understand and coin words that they are familiar with. The teaching practices follow the continuum of developing the related listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. The emphasis on building children’s existing knowledge and experience and conceptual clarity is equally relevant for other subjects such as Mathematics, Environmental Studies etc. There is a gradual movement from concrete to abstract. Mathematics, in particular, is seen as a subject that can help facilitate logical thinking. There is a comprehensive inclusion of arts component (details below). The inter linkages between all the subjects is also encouraged. Subject teaching is increasingly aligned with prescribed syllabi at the Shala Samooh level.",http://www.ngoimpact.com/ngoadmin/public/ngo_profile/logo_avtar/nidan-ngoimpact-72369.jpg,NIDAN Best Non-Government Organizations & Social Enterprises in India – NGO Impact,perm_identity Founded by Mr. Ratnish Verma ( 15 years of experience ),"room A 1/12, New Patliputra colony, Sagar Complex., Patna, Bihar- 800013",,Livelihoods / Poverty Alleviation,Jharkhand,0,₹ 0

Through the Right to Education Act, the Indian government aims to provide education for all children aged 6 to 14. However, this does not reach every child. We believe children deserve the best start in life and the chance to fulfill their potential. Our work helps provide them with early education and the opportunity to learn and develop. In Delhi, a particularly deprived group of people are the rag-picking community in Bhuapur. A community of migrants from very poor areas of India, they live in a garbage dump, without water, sanitation, shelter, health or education services. Life for children is appalling there. With their parents exploited and barely able to get enough food to survive, and with many children helping their parents to bring in money for the family, education is a low priority. But without school, the children will never break the cycle of poverty and deprivation and face a lifetime in the slums. It is essential they receive a basic education and give themselves the best chance for their future. Phia Foundation aims to provide these children with an education to help lift them out of desperate squalor and deprivation. Our project in Bhuapur provides children with this opportunity and works with their parents and others to ensure they are supported in receiving education. We aim to reach hundreds of children, providing them with ‘bridge’ schooling and enrolling them into formal schools. To do this we will: Establish education centres and provide school materials, including books and teaching aids Train community leaders to help ensure the effective running of the schools and work with parents to improve understanding on why education is so important for their children Provide clean water and healthy food to children to help improve their concentration and learning",http://www.ngoimpact.com/resources/assets/image/no-image-available.jpg,Partnering Hope Into Action Foundation Best Non-Government Organizations & Social Enterprises in India – NGO Impact,perm_identity Founded by Belinda Bennet ( 15 years of experience ),"room D25/D, S.J.House, South Extension Part II, New Delhi, Delhi- 110049",http://www.phia.org.in,Education,Delhi,0,₹ 0

When you approach a doctor, you trust and believe that he/she will give you the most appropriate medication or treatment.

As a result it is not impossible that they come across unreliable sources or outdated evidence. This obviously is not safe for patient care. As patients if you don’t know enough about sources, you are at the risk of trusting information that may not be authentic.

Rural and Tribal Development organization is established by Dr. D.V JAYAKUMAR M.A; B.Th; B.D (MBA); Ph.D (Founder and Managing Trustee), with the intention of developing rural areas and tribal people. According to Gandhian Philosophy, any nation can develop, only if the villages of that nation develop first. Hence our organization has selected rural areas for the all round development. Most of the area of  Madhya Pradesh is covered with mountains and forests and hence development is slow. Many of the areas are cut off from the main stream of life due to not having any approach/link roads. The district Hoshangabad is also of such area where development is very essential as most of the villages are tribal populated. This organization has initially taken up awareness campaigns to eradicate polio, AIDS, T.B, child labour and illiteracy in 15 villages around the target area. As literacy is the Forerunner of all developmental activities, this organization would like to enter first of all into the field of education. Literacy in Madhya Pradesh state and especially in the target area is very less due to forests, tribal domination and also due to lack of sufficient funds with the local Government.

Our methodology is focussed on raising awareness among community members on issues pertaining to health, hygiene, and sanitation. We conduct several workshops and Focussed Group Discussions (FGD) with children, youth, women, and men in communities. We also encourage the formation of slum level committees to take up issues related to the provision of various services with the local ward offices even after we have withdrawn from the community.

Homeless and slum communities host a variety of complex issues on a daily basis. Prominence of sexual and domestic abuse, unemployment, alcoholism, drug usage, malnutrition and mental health issues and a cycle of disengagement from the education sector almost condemn these communities to a continuing struggle- preventing them from being successfully involved in an already disparate society.

SPAN envisages a society that is economically productive and equitable, socially just, environmentally sound and genuinely democratic. The organization has been working since 26 years on the issue of child rights at the national and State level. SPAN’s mission is to work alongside the socially and economically excluded groups of people, starting with children. It works to enhance the rightful and equitable share of development for all who are disproportionately placed, by facilitating the process of empowerment and good governance. Over the past fifteen years SPAN has evolved through its concern and multifaceted involvement with issues like child development, women empowerment, livelihood concerns of marginal sections, especially unorganisedlabour (including child labour), and integrated rural development through natural resource management for livelihood and food security. On the other hand children mostly residing in urban areas of Kolkata and its periphery were provided access to quality education through community based study centers and through Anandadhara , a primary school. In all selected rural and urban work areas SPAN is implementing programmes designed to address long-term issues of community development backed up with advocacy action for pro-poor policy changes. The special focus has been to provide better overall convergence and inclusiveness of the programme. SPAN has organically evolved and grown with the changing times with its very own experiences of working with the community. A culture of open dialogue and sharing internally, amongst the staff and externally with the partner communities and stakeholders has been strongly encouraged. Thus several changes in its perspectives and its reflection on its strategies, programmes and projects are visible. The organization from a service based organization for specific target groups has gradually moved on to be a strong advocate of children and human rights. However, SPAN has looked at development holistically and ever since worked on several issues including Livelihood, Health, Protection of Children and Women, Natural resource Management, Empowering rural and urban poor on their rights, participation of the poor in rural governance besides Education of children which remained one of its focal activities.

Special emphasis is given on girl education and women education, so that they and their families get empowered. Children are the future of a nation. For an emerging and developing country like India, child education holds the key to the progress of the nation. 17 million children in India are working as child labour, spending day and night in dark rooms, houses, shops, or on open streets, struggling to earn two square meals a day. Education alone can free these kids from the bonds of child labour and give them a chance to fulfil their dreams. Education is both, the means as well as the end, to a better life – the means because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues – from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one's rights – and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen. The annual education and healthcare cost for a child is Rs. 6000. This includes the teaching learning material, two sets of uniform, nutrition, regular health check-ups and referrals. But many other qualitative aspects like access to libraries and computer education, training of the teachers to make the learning process effective, exposure visits to educational and recreational spaces and participation in co-curricular activities are also covered under this cost.",http://www.ngoimpact.com/ngoadmin/public/ngo_profile/logo_avtar/tamas-society-ngoimpact-84396.jpg,Tamas Society Best Non-Government Organizations & Social Enterprises in India – NGO Impact,perm_identity Founded by Mr. G.l Saha ( 15 years of experience ),"room 6B Rajani Bhattacharjee Lane, Rajani Bhattacharjee Lane, New Delhi, Delhi- 700026",http://www.tamassociety.com,Education,West Bengal,4,₹ 0

With its offices in twenty two countries worldwide, it implements the programs in twelve countries across Africa, South Asia and Latin America, with an innovative, holistic approach that empowers women and men living in rural villages to become the agents of their own development and make sustainable progress in overcoming hunger and poverty. Since 2001, The Hunger Project in India, has been working towards empowering Elected Women Representatives (EWRs) as key change agents in the local institutions of governance (Gram Panchayats) by strengthening their political leadership and participation with a women’s rights and gender perspective. It derives its mandate from the 73rd Constitutional Amendment (1992) which gave legal recognition to rural local self-governance units called Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and reserved thirty three percent of seats for women in the three-tier system of the PRIs. India has primarily relied upon the method of reservation to ensure women’s presence in decision making bodies and most recently, several Indian states have increased the reservation to fifty percent in Panchayats. The organization’s interventions strengthen the commitments made in various national laws, policies and action plans. Through its work, it also promotes, protects and upholds the rights of women under various International Conventions and Policies such as the CEDAW (UN Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women), the Mexico Plan of Action (1975); the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies (1985); the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995).

This initiative is the next logical step taken after the TII’s India Corruption Study, 2008 carried out to measure the extent of bribes paid by the rural below poverty line (BPL) households to avail the eleven basic (PDS, Hospitals, School Education, Electricity, Water Supply) and need based services (Land Records, Housing, Forest, NREGS, Banking & Police). The findings revealed that the total bribe amount paid by the BPL households in a year was Rs. 883 crore, this, however, doesn’t include operational irregularities or corruption not involving rural citizens directly. The average amount paid by a BPL household in India was Rs.550 per annum in 2007. Under the initiative we are working for the poor and marginalized rural masses to empower them to demand and access their entitlements and public services with the knowledge and use of the tools of good governance like RTI, social audit, revived gram sabhas, citizen’s charter and e-governance. Pahal also works towards people-centric, transparent and accountable governance through greater participation of women and disadvantaged sections in local self governance, increased responsiveness from local administration towards Gram Sabha (people’s assembly for self governance) and tools of good governance and active role of Panchayats in bottom-up planning and monitoring. Special features of Pahal: Model Gram Panchayats Model Gram Panchayats (GPs) that function efficiently and its people are well-informed, use the tools of good governance and participate in democratic processes Group of village leaders (especially including marginalized groups like women, tribals, etc) who are trained in using tools of good governance like RTI, citizen’s charter, social audit Village Information Centre for information dissemination, assistance and grievance handling Coordination with government offices and elected representatives to facilitate fair, hassle free and timely delivery of government services and schemes. Broad Project Outcomes Promoting tools of good governance: Due to training and awareness generation activities, villagers know about the tools of good governance like RTI, citizens’ charter and use them to demand services and emoluments from government officials and elected representatives through written applications instead of making verbal appeals. Facilitate Government Services Delivery: As advocacy efforts, the government machinery is sensitized to answer the RTI queries, display Citizens’ charters and other information in various government departments, facilitate social audits and deliver services timely and efficiently. Strengthening Local Self-Governance: In most of the places, Gram Sabhas are not properly conducted. TII aims to make the villagers aware about the local governance processes and make them participate. Sustainable Information Flow to rural areas: Village Information Centre acts as a hub for information dissemination-cum-community action for 4-5 adjacent Gram Panchayats. After the first pilot in Chhattisgarh, similar centers are being established in Orissa and Jharkhand as well. Creating Community Leadership: TII volunteer teams trained through this initiative act as catalyst in every village and spread the awareness on tools of good governance.

The Goal Udayan Ghars were set up to nurture orphaned and abandoned children, give them a loving home, family bonding and a sense of belonging, ensuring them all opportunities to develop as capable, responsible individuals. The Outcome and Impact The first Udayan Ghar was set up in Delhi with just 3 little girls. Today, 18 years later, the movement has spread to 13 Udayan Ghars in Delhi & NCR, Jaipur and Kurukshetra where 352 children - boys and girls - have been cared for. This Group Foster Care Model ensures children all the opportunities to enjoy their right to childhood and develop as socially integrated individuals with a self and family worth. Unique Aspects The Udayan Ghar Model, our own indigenously developed model and the first of its kind, is unique in many ways. Holistic Child Development Based on a strategy called L.I.F.E: Living In Family Environment, our homes look into every aspect of child development - from parenting to education and co-curricular activities, health etc to ensure children feel loved and well cared for. Individuals and Corporates also join hands through volunteering and the Corporate Mentoring Programme. Mentor Parents A novel parenting concept developed by Udayan Care, Mentor Parents are ordinary individuals with extraordinary sensitivity, who voluntarily commit themselves for life to groom the children just like their own. Sharing the joys and pains of growing up, Mentor Parents bring children a sense of continuity and stability, forming strong, family bonds. Small families Each Udayan Ghar unit is home to 10-15 children, to ensure individual attention for each child. There are separate homes for girls and boys varying between the ages of 6-18 years. Those above 18 are looked after in our After Care Programme , till they attain financial independence. Mental Health Framework Children in need of care and protection often suffer trauma due to neglect or abuse and are in need of care and counselling. A well-researched mental health frameworkhelps children come out of their initial trauma and develop a positive outlook towards life. Quality Education and Career Management Children are encouraged to study and are enrolled in some of the best schools . Their educational and professional training plans are developed with their participation. . Community Involvement All Udayan Ghars are located in busy middle class neighbourhoods, encouraging community interaction, so that children can re-integrate themselves with society. Capacity Building for Carers To enable care staff to fulfill their responsibilities effectively, sustained efforts are made to build capacities for Mentor Parents , care givers, social workers and Udayan Care staff working with children. Your Support Encouraged by our supporters from India and overseas, and the fulfilling lives of our children, we have plans to set up 17 more Udayan Ghars across India, by the year 2017, ensuring over 500 children their rights to a home, family and education so that they can develop their full potential. You can be part of our wonderful journey of transformation for children in many ways- Individuals and corporates can support various aspects of a child's development.

http://www.ngoimpact.com/ngos/wherever-the-need-india-services#profile,"Our primary focus is the alleviation of poverty. We do this in two simple, yet fundamental ways: 1. By introducing sanitation and water facilities that create and maintain good health, thereby giving individuals the ability to hold down a job. 2. By providing the infrastructure for work. With these two in place, the poorest people in the world can work their own way out of poverty rather than receive continual and long-lasting subsidies. We are after independence, not dependence. Wherever the Need India Services is a registered / incorporated under Section 25 of the 1956 Companies Act (ID No: U85190PY2009NPL002266); a non-profit organisation undertaking water and sanitation projects since 2,009. Since then, the Charity’s work has evolved through direct, on-the-ground experience to focus on what it believes to be the most important intervention that can be made in the development world – sanitation. Without proper, sustainable sanitation, no development work will be successful; every field of aid is impacted by its omission or lack of quality. Wherever the Need’s experience, borne out by data from ourselves and other agencies, has clearly shown that: • There is a major improvement in health leading to less work days missed – our data shows a 45% reduction within a year of toilets being installed (WTN, Pondicherry Baseline Survey 2014 and 2015); • Where sanitation facilities are installed in schools there is a 15% increase in the number of teenage girls enrolling (DFID data says 11%); • Children are sick less often which results in better school attendance records. Our data has shown a 43% reduction in school days lost twelve months after toilets being installed (WTN, Pondicherry Baseline Survey 2014 and 2015); • With half the hospital beds in the developing world being occupied by people suffering from diarrhoea, such improvements as shown above have a marked impact on personal, local and national healthcare costs (UN). Wherever the Need believe that any programme designed to alleviate poverty should start with sanitation. Without access to toilets people are forced to openly defecate, and this enables diseases to spread easily and quickly resulting in widespread intestinal illness. This not only impacts on people’s ability to work or attend school, but also means already stretched finances need to be allocated on necessary medication. Open defecation strips people of their dignity; women and girls are disproportionately disadvantaged as, with no security or safety, they are vulnerable to being assaulted or raped. Wherever the Need firmly believes in sustainable solutions and constructs ecological toilets (ecosan), otherwise known as Urine-Diverting Dry Toilets (UDDTs). 1. Sanitation facilities created in 58 Schools covering 24,823 children. In this, 14,700 girls and 10,123 boys got benefitted. 2. Existing sanitation facilities in 30 schools were repaired and brought back into use, benefitting another 18,640 children. In this; 11,230 girls and remaining 7,410 boys got benefitted. 3. Apart from the above, we have also helped the rural and urban children with sanitation facilities. 8,229 children (4,232 boys and 3,997 girls got the facilities. Through the sanitation facilities we could bring access to sanitation for a total of 17,179. 4. Hygiene education is an inherent part of the programme. At least 6 months to 8 months hygiene education is imparted. Apart from general health and hygiene practices education, menstrual hygiene education is also imparted to the girls in all the school. In the trainings for the village women group too we educate about the menstrual hygiene practices and needs. 5. In India 17,000+ people use our 2,350 Family ECOSAN toilets every day. 6. In Tamil Nadu about 12,740 people use them on a daily basis. 7. Currently WTNIS installed 90 urban ECOSAN units in slums of Cuddalore and Pondicherry.","MissionWherever the Need believe that any programme designed to alleviate poverty should start with sanitation. Without access to toilets people are forced to openly defecate, and this enables diseases to spread easily and quickly resulting in widespread intestinal illness. This not only impacts on people’s ability to work or attend school, but also means already stretched finances need to be allocated on necessary medication. Open defecation strips people of their dignity; women and girls are disproportionately disadvantaged as, with no security or safety.VisionImproved Health and economic status through the provision of Sustainable sanitation and hygiene awareness.",Charitable Society,AAATW2993G,5190PY2009NPL002266 - 25-02-2009,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"₹4,800,000",₹0,₹0,"₹4,800,000",₹0,₹0,₹0,12,14,10,16,"Business Development, Human Resources",12,5,,,N/A,credible alliance,6/1/2016,8/9/2020,N/A,Tamil Nadu,Chak Enayetnagar,N/A,₹0,₹0,0,Non-Government,,,"Project description Because of several tragic accidents that occurred in a number of provincial schools throughout India, guidelines were introduced as to how school buildings should be constructed.
