Aarambh provides these children with support classes in subjects like Math, English, Science, and Computers. The children also receive a daily mid-day meal.  The women beneficiaries receive training in tailoring via a course approved by Singer, the sewing machine company. The Aarambh certificate is highly regarded in the community, with many of the women being placed at nearby garment manufacturing mills, or taking private orders from home, thus being able to supplement the family income.  The youth in the community are trained in spoken English, and provided with computer based training programmes such as Tally, MS-CIT, etc. Aarambh has tie-ups with corporates to place these students in good quality jobs.  Aarambh has also undertaken following new initiatives:  School Adoption: Aarambh has adopted the Samata Hindi Vidyalaya at Turbhe which caters to the children of the poorest migrants in the area. Aarambh raised funds for the renovation of the school. E-learning Program: Audio-visual teaching aids are provided to municipal schools, for students of standards 1 to 8 in the Marathi and English mediums.
