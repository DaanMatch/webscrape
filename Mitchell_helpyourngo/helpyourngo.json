WSD strives to ensure the best possible care for stray dogs by taking a pragmatic and solution-oriented approach to eradicate rabies, control the stray dog population, educate the public about rabies prevention as well as promote the adoption of stray and homeless animals.  In 1989, WSD convinced the BMC to sterilize dogs rather than kill them to reduce the dog population and consequently the number of human deaths from rabies. Eventually the killing of stray dogs stopped in 1994.\u00a0  Some of their work include:   Mass Sterilisation:  WSD carries out an average of 150 sterilisations a month and has neutered 50,000 stray dogs till date at the kennels provided by the municipal corporation of Mumbai (BMC). WSD follows guidelines of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI). They practice strict hygienic procedures which are followed to ensure safety and care.    Rabies Eradication:  The WHO recommends mass vaccination of dogs as the most effective method of rabies eradication. WSD regularly vaccinates a large number of dogs on site. About 80,000 street dogs have been vaccinated against rabies. The number of human rabies deaths has also dropped from 45 in 1990 (when street dogs used to be killed by the BMC) to 1 in 2013.\u00a0    Healthcare & Rescue:  Sick or injured dogs are treated on site and serious cases are brought to WSD\u2019s Mahalaxmi centre. The organisation also runs a homeopathic clinic where stray animals are treated free of charge. They hold free workshops to educate the public twice a year. WSD covers more than 10,000 cases through the three healthcare programmes per year.    Adoption:  The organisation runs strict screening procedures to match the behaviour and temperament of dog to owner. WSD goes as far as providing behaviour counselling post-adoption.   WSD has so far impacted the lives of 140,000 street dogs through sterilization, vaccination, healthcare and adoption as on March 2015. "},

It serves the people in Karnataka  & Maharashtra. SRDS's focus is rainwater harvesting using modern techniques, thereby helping to solve the problem of water scarcity in rural and urban communities.  The NGO\u2019s mission is to restore ground water using water harvesting systems like borewell recharging. This is achieved by sensitising the community members and conducting awareness drives in drought prone villages. The NGO\u2019s vision/goal is to end water scarcity in India by 2020. With financial assistance from Deshpande Foundation and Sri Satya Sai Trust, SRDS has built more than 150 bore well structures in Haveri, Shiggaon and Savanur districts in Karnataka, and also in Aurangabad and Sangli, Maharashtra. In FY15, the NGO received support from Fidelity, USA.  Farmers Technology Transfer Fund (FTTF) was launched to conduct the following activities: (i) Conducting Gram Sabhas for imparting information on borewell recharge and the use of technology, (ii) Capacity building training for farmers on borewell recharge through rain water harvesting, (iii) Exposure visits for more than 1,000 farmers from different villages, and (iv) Wall paintings on borewells.  SRDS's founder, Mr. Sikandar Meernayak, devised a method to reduce the cost of constructing borewells by 60% in rural areas and 50% in urban areas.\u00a0The technique used by SRDS to recharge and conserve a water table involves digging up a large pond and directing rainwater to this catchment pond through a series of trenches and piping. This channelled water from ponds is then streamed out to a percolation pit to replenish the water tables and aquifers. This technique is cost-effective, eco-friendly and can be customised to the needs of farmers.\u00a0  To create awareness about water conservation in the minds of villagers and farmers, SRDS paints pictures depicting water saving on the walls of hutments. In FY15, the NGO made wall paintings in 67 villages. "},

It works with, and for, the community to enhance livelihood that centres on Natural Resource Management. The organisation facilitates optimal use of resources and services for community benefit. It works in partnership with other organisations in the development sector to make the best use of government policies and schemes.  PRASARI works in two opposite agro-climatic zones of West Bengal. One district is located at the hilly Jalpaiguri (Himalayan Dooars) and the other is at the delta in the Sundarbans (near Bay of Bengal). Both receive adequate rainfall but still suffer from water scarcity, either due to impermeable land or intrusion of salinity. To help the residents, PRASARI emphasizes gravity based surface flow management and water harvesting.  In the past, PRASARI started out with System of Rice Intensification (SRI) as an entry point activity in all the villages it worked with. It would then shortlist the families which needed help in improving their livelihood. Self Help Groups (SHGs) were the primary community platform used for any sort of intervention. The groups were nurtured by the trained staff of PRASARI with a plan to achieve a targeted annual incremental income.  The NGO has shifted from a sub-sector approach of promoting SRI to family based interventions incorporating all other existing natural resources (agriculture, livestock and birds, and fishery). This has had three categorical effects on the families: 1) Year-long engagement with the families versus seasonal interventions; 2) Diversifying income sources and minimising the risks of single activity failure; 3) Generating \u2018double arrows\u2019 of increasing income and reducing expenditures.  Interventions in livelihoods in the past six years have exhibited some limitations and the learning thereof has led to interventions in addressing nutrition security, providing health awareness, and minimum bare-foot health support. PRASARI has also successfully launched a pilot program at the Sundarbans on \u2018securing nutrition for children from home based resources\u2019 through calculated resource use for growing nutrients. An assessment on the prevalent diseases with mothers has been done and based on this assessment, a support plan has been designed for execution. "},

In 2011, PNLIT signed an MOU with Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for lake restoration & officially maintaining the lake.  Major activities are:   Till date, more than 300 fruit-yielding, flowering and shade-providing tree saplings have been planted and are carefully chosen to attract birds and butterflies. The pressure is high to ensure that the plants receive enough water to sustain through dry summer months as butterflies and other insects thrive in the butterfly garden. A simple bottle drip irrigation method is initiated and implemented in several places in the lake area.  To manage the weeds that would otherwise threaten the lake and the life it supports, PNLIT undertakes regular deweeding. With the support of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) and volunteers, a pre-monsoon cleaning of the lake bed was done.  PNLIT conducts a weekend program which encourages people from the neighbourhood and also from other parts of the city to help at the lake. The Corporate Volunteer Program enables corporates who are governed by the mandatory CSR norms to meet some of their CSR obligations.  PNLIT organizes educational and cultural programs; the first program held at Puttenahalli Lake was a bird watching session, in Sept 2011. Since then, the lake has seen a variety of events for both children and adults including guided nature walks, school-organised nature walks, birthday tours, workshops of various kinds, story-telling sessions, awareness talks, science festivals, art-craft sessions, etc.  PNLIT\u2019s Teach Program is managed by volunteers who live in the lake vicinity, where underprivileged children living near the lake have been getting special coaching in subjects like English and Computer Science, among others, free of cost.

Their dream is to see a country where every child wants to read, is able to read, and has something good to read.  A large number of Indian NGOs are engaged in increasing child literacy. Research reveals that one in three school-going children cannot read fluently. Children who are unable to read are unable to learn, as they can't understand what is being taught to them. This contributes to high dropout rates in schools. Pratham Books supports child literacy by publishing and distributing affordable books to children who have limited reading resources.  In the last decade, Pratham Books has published over 300 titles in English and 18 major Indian languages. The NGO has printed story-cards to jump start a love for reading. A majority of the 2,000 books\u00a0published to date are priced below Rs50. With the aim to reach 200 million Indian children, Pratham Books continues to build alliances with leading publishing houses (like Orient Longman) to achieve this goal.  Story Weaver is a platform that hosts stories in languages from all across India, so that every child can have an endless stream of stories in her mother tongue to read and enjoy. All the stories are available under Creative Commons licenses which means that the stories are free to read, and can be translated into new languages, new stories can be created, and artworks can be freely accessed, by anyone.  Donate-a-Book is a unique crowd funding initiative by Pratham Books to help bridge the gap between those who want to help children read, and those who need books for children. The idea is to build a Reading India together by making storybooks accessible to thousands of children and spread the joy of reading. Around 42,000 books have been pledged so far under the Donate-a-Book initiative.\u00a0 "},

MC created parent groups and had sessions with them on safety, protection, cleanliness, nutrition on ECD. Fathers too are playing an active role in these groups.

They work in three districts namely Adilabad, Anantapur and Chittoor. These districts were selected because: a) they received very low & scanty annual rain fall; b) they had a large population of small & marginal farmers; c) agriculture was largely dependent on rainfed conditions (only one cropping season per year); and d) the districts are among the poorest in India.  CCD work involves two aspects. The first is social mobilization in the villages which includes meeting potential new members in new villages, holding meetings, discussing the benefits of forming cooperatives. Once they agree to come together into a cooperative, CCD conducts intensive training programs on cooperative education and on business. The Cooperatives in each District are organized into District level Federations. Each Federation owns and runs a food processing unit at present. The second aspect of the work is related to business development. CCD continuously studies the markets for the four commodities it works with, soyabean, groundnut, Bengal gram and Tur dal. CCD achieved a remarkable milestone by setting up a Cooperative Dal Mill which is the first ever mill in the tribal areas of India. The Mill has provided employment opportunities for the nearby villagers and it has been found that after the value addition of the raw products, it provided an additional Rs200-250 to the members. Some of their projects are:   \u2018Wadi\u2019 or \u2018Maa Thota\u2019 Project:  This project is operational in 2 Mandals (Jainoor and Indravelly) of Adilabad district of Andhra Pradesh. Under this project 12 villages were covered to grow different types of plants in the CCD Project area.  Watershed Development:\u00a0  Under this project the main focus areas are soil and moisture conservation and providing loans for livelihood interventions for the poor, and agricultural productivity enhancement of small and marginal farmers.
